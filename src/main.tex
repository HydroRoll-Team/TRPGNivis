\section{Introduction}
This section introduces the Psi CLI language and its features.

\section{Features}
This section describes the key features of the Psi CLI language.

\subsection{Lexer Module}
The lexer module is responsible for converting source code into a sequence of tokens.

\subsection{Parser Module}
The parser module converts the token sequence into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

\subsection{Built-in Types Module}
The built-in types module defines the built-in types of the Psi language, such as lists and dictionaries.

\subsection{Error Handling Module}
The error handling module provides mechanisms for capturing and handling errors at runtime.

\subsection{Execution Environment Module}
The execution environment module defines the execution environment of the Psi language.

\subsection{Interpreter Module}
The interpreter module executes operations based on the AST within the execution environment.

\subsection{Mathematics Foundation Module}
The mathematics foundation module provides basic mathematical functions and constants.

\subsection{Documentation Module}
The documentation module provides API interface descriptions and usage examples.
